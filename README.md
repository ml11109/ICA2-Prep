Navigation is in MainActivity, ViewModel and data classes in data, some premade screens and composables in ui, functions to use phone functionalities in utils.

Comments are written above each function for implementation details.

For ICA, you can just clone the entire repository and add your code in Main.kt, and copy paste / modify composables in Composables.kt as needed.

To be added, maybe:
- More internal services
- More transitions
